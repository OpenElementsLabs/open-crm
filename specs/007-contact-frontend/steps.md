# Implementation Steps: Contact Frontend

## Step 1: Type Definitions & API Client

- [ ] Add `ContactDto` interface to `frontend/src/lib/types.ts` with all fields (id, firstName, lastName, email, position, gender, linkedInUrl, phoneNumber, companyId, companyName, syncedToBrevo, doubleOptIn, language, createdAt, updatedAt) — all `readonly`
- [ ] Add `ContactCreateDto` interface to `frontend/src/lib/types.ts` (firstName, lastName, language required; email, position, gender, linkedInUrl, phoneNumber, companyId optional)
- [ ] Add `ContactListParams` interface to `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` (page, size, sort, firstName, lastName, email, companyId, language)
- [ ] Add `getContacts(params)` function to `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` — GET `/api/contacts` with query params
- [ ] Add `getContact(id)` function — GET `/api/contacts/{id}`
- [ ] Add `createContact(data)` function — POST `/api/contacts`
- [ ] Add `updateContact(id, data)` function — PUT `/api/contacts/{id}`
- [ ] Add `deleteContact(id)` function — DELETE `/api/contacts/{id}`
- [ ] Add `getCompaniesForSelect()` function — GET `/api/companies?includeDeleted=false&size=1000&sort=name,asc`, returns `content` array only

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Project builds successfully (`pnpm build` in frontend)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles with no errors
- [ ] API functions follow existing patterns (fetch with `cache: "no-store"`, error handling)

**Related behaviors:** None directly — this step provides the foundation for all subsequent steps.

---

## Step 2: i18n Strings

- [ ] Add `contacts` section to `frontend/src/lib/i18n/de.ts` with German translations for: title, newContact, empty, notFound, columns (firstName, lastName, company, actions), detail (title, edit, delete, fields, archivedBadge, brevo labels, commentsPlaceholder), form (createTitle, editTitle, field labels, placeholders, validation messages, save, cancel, noCompany, notSpecified), deleteDialog (title, description with permanent warning and comment loss, confirm, cancel), filter (firstName, lastName, email, company, language), pagination (previous, next, page), sort (label, options)
- [ ] Add matching `contacts` section to `frontend/src/lib/i18n/en.ts` with English translations
- [ ] Add `nav.contacts` entry to both translation files (DE: "Kontakte", EN: "Contacts")

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] Both language files have identical key structure for the `contacts` section
- [ ] `nav.contacts` key exists in both files

**Related behaviors:** Displays German strings by default, Displays English strings when selected

---

## Step 3: Sidebar Navigation

- [ ] Import `Users` icon from lucide-react in `frontend/src/components/sidebar.tsx`
- [ ] Add contacts navigation item `{ label: t.nav.contacts, href: "/contacts", icon: <Users /> }` below the companies entry

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] "Kontakte" / "Contacts" entry appears in sidebar below "Firmen" / "Companies"
- [ ] Active highlighting works on `/contacts` routes

**Related behaviors:** Shows contacts entry in sidebar, Highlights active contacts page

---

## Step 4: Contact List Page & Component

- [ ] Create `frontend/src/app/contacts/page.tsx` — server component with `force-dynamic`, renders `ContactList`
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/components/contact-list.tsx` — client component following CompanyList patterns:
  - State for data, loading, page, sort, filters (firstName, lastName, email, companyId, language)
  - Filter inputs: text inputs for firstName/lastName/email, Select for company (loaded via `getCompaniesForSelect()`), Select for language (DE/EN/all)
  - Sort dropdown: lastName ASC/DESC, firstName ASC/DESC, createdAt ASC/DESC
  - Pagination: Previous/Next buttons, page indicator
  - Table columns: First name, Last name, Company name
  - Row click navigates to `/contacts/{id}`
  - Delete button per row with `DeleteConfirmDialog` (permanent deletion warning + comment loss warning)
  - Empty state message with "New contact" button
  - Loading skeleton during fetch
  - All strings from `useTranslations().contacts`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] `/contacts` page renders contact list
- [ ] Filters, sorting, and pagination work
- [ ] Delete from list works with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Empty state shown when no contacts match

**Related behaviors:** Displays contacts on page load, Shows empty state when no contacts exist, Shows empty state for filtered results with no matches, Filters by first name, Filters by last name, Filters by email, Filters by company, Filters by language, Sorts contacts, Paginates results, Shows company name in list, Shows empty company column for unassociated contacts, Navigates to detail on row click, Shows permanent deletion warning, Warns about comment loss, Deletes contact on confirmation, Cancels deletion

---

## Step 5: Contact Detail Page & Component

- [ ] Create `frontend/src/app/contacts/[id]/page.tsx` — server component with `force-dynamic`, fetches contact, shows `notFound()` on error
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/components/contact-detail.tsx` — client component following CompanyDetail patterns:
  - Display all fields in grid layout: firstName, lastName, email, position, gender, phone, linkedInUrl, language
  - Company name — show "Archived" badge if company is soft-deleted (check via companyName presence + additional indicator)
  - Brevo fields: syncedToBrevo and doubleOptIn as disabled checkboxes with labels
  - Optional fields show dash "—" when null
  - Edit button navigates to `/contacts/{id}/edit`
  - Delete button with `DeleteConfirmDialog` (permanent warning + comment loss)
  - After delete, navigate to `/contacts`
  - Comments section: placeholder heading with disabled "Add comment" button
  - All strings from `useTranslations().contacts`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] `/contacts/{id}` renders contact detail
- [ ] All fields displayed correctly, optional fields show dash
- [ ] Brevo checkboxes are read-only
- [ ] Edit and delete buttons work

- [ ] Comments placeholder shown

**Related behaviors:** Displays all contact fields, Displays Brevo fields as read-only checkboxes, Shows archived badge for soft-deleted company, Handles missing optional fields gracefully, Shows comments placeholder, Navigates to edit page, Shows 404 for non-existent contact (detail), Shows permanent deletion warning, Warns about comment loss, Deletes contact on confirmation, Cancels deletion

---

## Step 6: Contact Form & Route Pages (Create + Edit)

- [ ] Create `frontend/src/app/contacts/new/page.tsx` — server component rendering `ContactForm` in create mode
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/app/contacts/[id]/edit/page.tsx` — server component fetching contact, rendering `ContactForm` in edit mode, `notFound()` on error
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/components/contact-form.tsx` — client component following CompanyForm patterns:
  - Dual mode: create (no `contact` prop) and edit (`contact` prop provided)
  - Required fields: firstName (text input), lastName (text input), language (Select: DE/EN, no empty option)
  - Optional fields: email (text input), position (text input), gender (Select: MALE/FEMALE/DIVERSE + "Not specified" empty option), linkedInUrl (text input), phoneNumber (text input), companyId (Select loaded via `getCompaniesForSelect()` + "No company" empty option)
  - Client-side validation: firstName and lastName not blank, language selected
  - Validation error messages shown inline below fields
  - Server-side error displayed below form
  - Submit: POST (create) or PUT (edit), navigate to detail page on success
  - Cancel: navigate to `/contacts` (create) or `/contacts/{id}` (edit)
  - Edit mode pre-fills all fields with existing contact data
  - All strings from `useTranslations().contacts`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] `/contacts/new` renders create form
- [ ] `/contacts/{id}/edit` renders edit form with pre-filled data
- [ ] Required field validation works (firstName, lastName, language)
- [ ] Company dropdown shows only active companies + "No company" option
- [ ] Gender dropdown has MALE/FEMALE/DIVERSE + "Not specified"
- [ ] Submit creates/updates contact and navigates to detail
- [ ] Cancel navigates correctly (list for create, detail for edit)
